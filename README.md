MongoDB and React Project

This project combines MongoDB as the backend database with a React frontend. It allows users to manage tasks with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Features

    User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
    Task Management: CRUD operations for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
    Sorting and Filtering: Sort tasks by date, title, or user. Filter tasks by status (completed or pending).
    Responsive Design: Responsive frontend design for various screen sizes.

Technologies Used

    Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
    Frontend: React, Axios
    Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
    Styling: CSS (or preferred CSS framework)
    Deployment: Heroku (backend), Netlify (frontend)

Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:
Prerequisites

    Node.js and npm installed on your machine
    MongoDB Atlas account (for cloud database) or MongoDB installed locally

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

Install dependencies:

bash

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install

Set up environment variables:

    Create .env file in backend directory and add MongoDB connection URI, JWT secret, and any other necessary environment variables.

    For example:

    makefile

    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

Run the application:

bash

    # Start the backend server (from backend directory)
    npm start

    # Start the frontend server (from frontend directory)
    npm start

    Access the application:

    Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the React frontend.
